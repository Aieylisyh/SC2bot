SC2 should be installed in the default location. 
Otherwise (and for Linux) 
you might need to create the SC2PATH environment variable to point to the SC2 install location.




	in powershell
		python -m venv venv
# and then...
venv\Scripts\activate # Windows
source venv/bin/activate # Mac OS / Linux




Test the bot is working by running it:

python ./run.py






Adding new code
As you add features to your bot make sure all your new code files are in the bot folder. This folder is included when creating the ladder.zip for upload to the bot ladders.

Competing with your bot
To compete with your bot, you will first need zip up your bot, ready for distribution.
You can do this using the create_ladder_zip.py script like so:

python create_ladder_zip.py

This will create the zip file publish\bot.zip.
You can then distribute this zip file to competitions.
